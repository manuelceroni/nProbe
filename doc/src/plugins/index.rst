nProbe Plugins
##############

nProbe has been designed as an engine that processes packets and compute basic statistics, and plugins that extend the core with additional capabilities. Each plugin dissects a specific traffic (e.g. SMTP email traffic), but you can enable the use of multiple plugins simultaneously.


.. note::

    nProbe based on the template configuration (-T) will selectively enable plugins and define as many templates as necessary. Their number depends on the plugins enabled and on the fact that you might enable IPv4 and/or IPv6 traffic support.

.. warning::

    Plugins require a license to be enabled. See :ref:`licensing` for further information. Plugin-specific template elements will be ignored if the corresponding plugin is not licensed.


Plugins help can be printed using the option :code:`-H`.

.. code:: bash

    nprobe -H

This will print an extended help with all the available plugins, along with their respective options and supported flow information elements. For example, for the HTTP plugin, the following information will be printed when using :code:`nprobe -H`:

.. code:: bash

The following sections cover the configuration and information elements provided by each individual plugin. Most plugins are available also in source format, but sometimes due to license restrictions (e.g. the plugin has been sponsored by a company that does not want others to access the source code) we are unable to release all plugins in source format.
